The AHK Logo is for startup splash (just letting people, e.g. my brother) know that some of the numpads do other stuff... 
  "I tried to enter a zipcode and your computer reacted like I was entering NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES!" - anonymous *wink*

The shortcut jpg is what I use to tell me what the keys do. When it's "full," I print it, cut them out, and tape them to the keys like the OCD person I am. 

keymap.ini is so that you don't have to code all your own numberpad entries in intercept. It's a little bit of a pain in the rear... 

New Numpad ahk.txt is what I use when I start coding a new numberpad, it was all the hotkeys built in. 

(redacted)Keyboard_Shortcuts.ahk is the bread and butter, I've notated thoroughly throughout.
